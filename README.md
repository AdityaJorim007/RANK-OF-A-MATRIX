# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1: Import the numpy module to use the built-in functions for calculation
### Step 2: Create the array 
### Step 3: Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.
### Step 4: End the program
## Program:
```python
#Program to find the rank of a matrix.
#Developed by: Aditya Jorim F S
#RegisterNumber: 25008164
#The number of linearly independent rows or columns in a matrix is known as its rank

import numpy as np
A=[[1,2,3],[3,6,9]]
rank=np.linalg.matrix_rank(A)
print(rank)
```
